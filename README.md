### 5 Card Poker

This small game takes a lot of inspiration from luigi poker minigame from "New super mario bros" on the DS

So there are many parallels between the two.

#### Replacing Cards
You can click on the cards to "select" them so that when you press the button to trade them, they will be replaced.

#### Betting
You can open a bet menu to decide what you would like to bet for this round, upon submitting it, your money will be taken so you can get higher yields.

#### Folding
If you get a hand that may be undesirable and replacing won't save you, there is an option to fold and only lose the initial call of the round.

### Interacting With Dealer

This game defers from it's inspiration by adding a furry dealer to communicate with. 

#### Looking up at the dealer

Using your mouse you can choose to "look up" and see the dealer, this mostly represents eye contact.

#### Interacting with the dealer

Occasionaly the dealer will speak with you, or you can choose to initiate conversations.
